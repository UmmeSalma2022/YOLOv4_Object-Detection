# YOLOv4_Object-Detection

YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once version 4) is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm that was introduced in 2020. It is an improvement over previous versions of YOLO, offering higher accuracy, faster processing times, and improved performance on small objects and crowded scenes.

The YOLOv4 algorithm works by dividing the input image into a grid of cells and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for each cell. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to extract features from the input image and perform object detection in a single forward pass, making it very fast and efficient.

YOLOv4 also incorporates several advanced features to improve its accuracy, including a new CSPDarknet53 backbone, Mish activation function, and spatial pyramid pooling module. Additionally, it uses multiple anchor boxes of different sizes and aspect ratios to better capture the variations in object shapes and sizes.

One of the major advantages of YOLOv4 is its speed and real-time performance. It is capable of detecting and localizing objects in video streams at up to 65 frames per second on a single GPU. This makes it ideal for applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics, where real-time object detection is critical.

In summary, YOLOv4 is a powerful and efficient object detection algorithm that offers state-of-the-art performance in terms of speed and accuracy. Its ability to perform real-time object detection makes it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications in computer vision and artificial intelligence.
